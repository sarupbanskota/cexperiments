============

This repository contains some solutions to questions from [the book on C by Kerninghan and Ritchie](http://bit.ly/1xDYXcc) (While I was playing around with some C).
Similar to my [SPOJ repository](https://github.com/sarupbanskota/SPOJ), I mainly started this repository to pick up some version control skills, so you'll probably find it to be inactive now.
